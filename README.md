# Osu-Auto-Emulator
# version 1.0.0
# Script should auto-pass osu maps, based on information from the osu map file, but now have a lot of bugs
# Now script can open osu!, enter the map and click only single notes, cant pass sliders, streams and spinners
# A big problem with synchronization, maybe in future i will fix this problems

# ------------------------------------------------------

# Need to write in start_config.txt full path to osu!.exe, folder with chosen song and song name as a dictionary format
